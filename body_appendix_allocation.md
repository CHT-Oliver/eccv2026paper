# Main Body vs Appendix Allocation

## Main Body (must stay in paper)
- Section 4.1: Exact isotropy decomposition and interpretation.
- Section 4.2: Finite-support phase cancellation bound and near-frequency coupling mechanism.
- Section 4.3: Bridge from logit variance to softmax concentration and coverage compression.
- Section 5.2: Effective-rank degradation signal definition and failure boundary.
- Section 5.3: Dual-gate equations plus monotonicity/extreme-case interpretation.
- Section 5.4: Injection equation, covariance dynamics proposition, and complexity convention.

## Appendix (recommended expansion)
- Full proof details of Theorem 4.1 (algebraic decomposition steps).
- Alternative bounds for Section 4.2 and tighter conditions under different non-stationarity assumptions.
- Extended gate variants in Section 5.3 (alternative robust statistics and their tradeoffs).
- Additional symbol table and derivation details omitted from main text.

## Principle
- Main body keeps the shortest complete proof-to-method chain.
- Appendix carries complete derivation details and alternative formulations for auditability.
